# Scholarmate: Automated Literature Review System (ALRS)

Welcome to the repository for Scholarmate, the Automated Literature Review System (ALRS), developed as part of my final year thesis. This repository contains both the software implementation of Scholarmate and the accompanying paper detailing its design, methodology, and findings.

## Publication

I'm proud to announce that the paper associated with this project has been published, validating the significance of our work in the academic community. You'll find the certificate for its publication included in this repository.

## Project Overview

Scholarmate represents a significant advancement in the field of literature review automation. In today's fast-paced research environment, staying abreast of the latest developments in any field is paramount. However, the traditional manual literature review process is time-consuming and prone to human error.

Scholarmate addresses these challenges by employing a multimodal approach, leveraging various data sources and summarization techniques to expedite the literature review process without compromising on quality. Our approach is the culmination of extensive research, documented in the associated paper.

## Acknowledgments

I extend my gratitude to [FAST NUCES Islamabad] for their support and guidance throughout the development of Scholarmate and the associated research paper.
